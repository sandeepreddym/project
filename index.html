          <p class="article">Plant oils are the major source of highly-reduced carbon available from Nature.  
             The ability to control the chemical structure of this stored carbon represents  
             a vital step towards producing renewable biomaterials that can replace petro-chemicals. 
             The discoveries that result from this project will yield an understanding of  
             the underlying principles of how pathways evolved for the synthesis of novel seed oils.  
             It is our vision that basic knowledge from this project will enable bio-technological  
             design of a new generation of specialty crops that will become the green factories of 
             the future.
          </p>
          <p >This interdisciplinary project aims to make fundamental discoveries about 
             metabolic networks that govern the accumulation of modified fatty acids (mFA), which 
             occur in a wide range of plant species with hundreds of diverse chemical structures. 
             Components of the mFA networks will be identified by integrative approaches including 
             comparative genomics, biochemical-genetic analysis, flux analysis and mathematical 
             modeling in selected mFA-accumulating source species and closely related non-mFA-accumulating 
             plants. Network functions will be evaluated in transgenic seeds with native or 
             improved mFA-synthesizing enzymes by biochemical and proteomic analyses and the mFA 
             network will be optimized based on metabolic modeling. The knowledge gained in this 
             project will guide efforts to engineer high levels of economically important mFA in 
             transgenic crops.

            <p><br />
              Cotton seeds synthesize cyclopropane FA (CpFA).  
              CpFA are prized for their combination of oxidative 
              stability and low viscosity.  
              These properties make them ideally suited for 
              applications as lubricants and biodiesel

            <p><br />
              Momordica charantia produces conjugated FA (CFA).   
              CFA are used in drying oils and can serve as replacements 
              to petroleum additives to reduce VOC emissions from paints 
              and other coating materials.

            <p><br />
              Castor and lesquerella seeds produce the hydroxy fatty acid (HFA). 
              HFA and derivatives are used in lubricants, nylon, soaps, and adhesives.
              Industrial processes consume 600-800 million lbs of HFA each year, and 
              demand is growing rapidly.

<h2>OBJECTIVES:</h2>
    <div class="section">
          <p>Our <strong>overall goal</strong> is to use genomic approaches to
              drive an increased understanding of the network of enzymatic and other
              processes involved in the production of seed TAGs, and in particular
              how these processes have coevolved to facilitate the synthesis and
              accumulation of unusual fatty acids.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Our <strong>specific objectives</strong> under
              this grant are to:</p>
          <ol>
             <li>To identify components of the mFA-producing networks 
                that evolved to allow for efficient accumulation of mFA.&nbsp;We will 
                conduct comparative transcriptomics between species of mFA accumulators 
                and closely-related non-accumulators.&nbsp;Identification of regulatory 
                factors will be complemented by yeast-one-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation 
                assays.</li>
                </br>
              <li>To assemble the mFA biosynthetic pathways.&nbsp;We will 
                investigate and optimize the activities of FAH, CONJ and CPS using protein 
                engineering and directed evolution.&nbsp;Roles of candidate genes/enzymes 
                involved in the mFA fluxes through PC will be assessed through expression  
                in transgenic plants.&nbsp;Stable isotope labeling experiments and rigorous 
                mathematical modeling will be used to answer specific questions about 
                the metabolic bottlenecks of mFA during oil synthesis.</li>
                </br>
              <li>To optimize the accumulation of high levels of mFA in 
                transgenic seeds.&nbsp;We will evaluate plant responses to mFA accumulation by 
                gene expression changes in transgenic plants using deep sequencing of transcripts.&nbsp;Endogenous, 
                competing enzymes will be suppressed through gene silencing.&nbsp;In addition, 
                we will evaluate the feedback inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in 
                transgenic lines using directed proteomics approaches and use the information 
                gained to mitigate the inhibition.</li>
                </br>
              <li>To broaden public understanding and excite young students 
                about the potential of plants to serve as chemical factories of the future.&nbsp;
                We will train current and future plant scientists to apply genomics in a focused 
                way to solve long-standing questions in complex biosynthetic pathways and to 
                appreciate how the answers to these questions can aid society.</li>
